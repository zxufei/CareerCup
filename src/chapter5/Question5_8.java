	 * A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels
	 * to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8(that is, no byte
	 * will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length
	 * of the array and the width. Implement a function drawHorizontalLine(byte[] screen, int width,
	 * int x1, int x2, int y) which draws horizontal line from (x1,y) to (x2,y).

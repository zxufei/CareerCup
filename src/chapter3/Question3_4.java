	 * @param args
	 * In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of 
	 * different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks
	 * sorted in a ascending order of size from top to bottom(i.e. each disk sits on top
	 * of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:
	 * (1)Only one disk can be moved at a time
	 * (2)A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next rod.
	 * (3)A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
	 * Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using Stacks.

	 * "first in, first out"basis. People must adopt either the "oldest"(based on arrival time)
	 * of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer
	 * a dog or a cat(and will receive the oldest animal of that type).They cannot select
	 * which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system
	 * and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, deququeDog and deququeCat. 
	 * You may use the built-in Linkedlist data structure.

	/** See SetOfStacks.java
	 * @param args
	 * Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
	 * Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack
	 * exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this.
	 * SetOfStack should be compressed of several stacks and should create a new stack once
	 * the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should
	 * behave identically to a single stack(that is ,pop() should return the same values as
	 * it would if there were just a single stack).
	 * FOLLOW UP
	 * Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack
